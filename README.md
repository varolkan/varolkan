# 👋 Hi

**Mechatronics Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Robotics Enthusiast**

I am a Mechatronics Engineer bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. My expertise spans from low-level C++ controlling high-speed motors to React front-ends for user interaction. I apply a system-level approach to software development, built on control theory, PCB design, and embedded programming.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Robotics and Full-Stack Web Development**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Advanced Embedded Systems & Economics**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **IoT, Robotics, and Complex System Projects**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I like pizza**
